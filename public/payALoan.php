                                <li>Provides the end user with multiple methods (web, IVR and Call Center) to pay their loans, credit cards, business loans, at the Financial Institution that are consolidated into one platform and one posting&nbsp;file.</li>
                                <li>Delivery of summary and detailed loan statement information is available to the end&nbsp;user.</li>
                                <li>Numerous funding options are available including internal and external checking/savings accounts and debit&nbsp;cards.</li>
                                <li>Provides the end user with flexibility to choose when to make their payment, 24x7 as well as “set it and forget it” recurring payment&nbsp;option.</li>
                                <li>End users can receive reminders and notifications regarding due dates and scheduled&nbsp;payments.</li>
                                <li>Payment methods and communications are branded to the Financial Institution, so the end user does not feel as if they are going to a third-party&nbsp;site.</li>

                                <li>Service Representatives can fully support an end user (take/schedule payments, research previously made payments, reset passwords,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
                                <li>Dramatically reduces the number of check payments which streamlines the bill payment&nbsp;process.</li>
